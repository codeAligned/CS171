PROGRAM: wireframe

Usage: ./wireframe [xRes] [yRes]

This program takes the size of the image to be created, and parses Camera and Separator
blocks to create the resulting ppm, which is outputed to cout.

To read in a file to be parsed intead of user input, pass a file in as follows:
./wireframe 400 400 < hw2-data/fourCubes.iv

To save the output PPM format to a file instead of cout, send to a file as follows:
./wireframe 400 400 < hw2-data/fourCubes.iv > fourCubes.ppm
(Note: could also pipe to display or convert instead of saving to a file)

PROGRAM: shaded

Usage: ./shaded n [xRes] [yRes]

This program takes n (the shading mode; 0 = Flat, 1 = Gouraud, 2 = Phong) and
the size of the image to be created, and parses Camera and Separator
blocks to create the resulting ppm, which is outputed to cout.

To read in a file to be parsed intead of user input, pass a file in as follows:
shaded 0 400 400 < hw3-data/lion1.iv

To save the output PPM format to a file instead of cout, send to a file as 
follows: shaded 0 400 400 < hw3-data/lion1.iv > out.ppm
(Note: could also pipe to display or convert instead of saving to a file)

In addition, 3 scripts are provided that will produce .ppm files for each 
available .iv file in /hw3-data.
./doFlat - 
    Produces a .ppm with Flat lighting for each .iv file.  Stores these .ppm 
    files in the directory flat, (corresponding .debug outputs are created
    and store anything that goes to std::cerr).
./doGouraud - 
    Produces a .ppm with Gouraud lighting for each .iv file.  Stores these 
    .ppm files in the directory gouraud, (corresponding .debug outputs are 
    created and store anything that goes to std::cerr).
./doPhong - 
    Produces a .ppm with Phong lighting for each .iv file.  Stores these .ppm 
    files in the directory phong, (corresponding .debug outputs are created
    and store anything that goes to std::cerr).

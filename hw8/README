To compile this program, simple type "make". (or if on OSX update the Makefile
LDFLAGS line accordingly).

This will create an executable called "glslRenderer".

PROGRAM: glslRenderer

Usage: ./glslRenderer xRes yRes

For example, run as follows:
./glslRenderer 600 600

The program reads in a sky and leaf .png files, and uses a vertex shader and 
fragment shader to animate a water surface with leaves on top.  We start in the
default "per-vertex" mode, where the normals are calculated per vertex.
Pressing 'w' toggles to the "per-fragment" mode, where the normal is calculated
at every fragment, and thus should give a smoother surface.

UI 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
'w': toggle between 'per-vertex' and 'per-fragment' modes for calculating normals.

Click and drag to rotate the plane.

Exit the program with 'q', 'Q', or the Esc key.

To compile this program, simple type "make". (or if on OSX update the Makefile
CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS lines accordingly).

This will create an executable called "keyframe".

PROGRAM: keyframe

Usage: ./keyframe script-file-name

For example, run as follows:
./keyframe hw7-data/sample.script

The program reads in keyframes in the script file, and uses cubic interpolation
to generate data for all the in-between frames.  We draw an I-bar near the 
origin, making it easy to see the resulting animation taking place.

UI for the Animation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
'p': play the animation
's': stop the playback
'f': move forward one frame
'r': go backward one frame
'l': toggle looping mode on/off.  If looping mode is enabled, playback will go 
	back to frame 0 after it gets to the last frame.
'j' + NUM + 'Enter': Hit J and then type a number and hit enter to jump to 
	that frame.
'0': go to frame 0

Extra commands:
'w': toggle the X,Y,Z axes on and off.
'x': decrease the animation speed during playback
'z': increase the animation speed during playback

UI for the Camera
--------------------------------------------------------------------
'Up': Uparrow key to move the camera towards the origin (ZOOM in)
'Down': Down arrow key to move the camera backwards (ZOOM out)
'Left': Left arrow key to rotate the camera to the left around origin.
'Right': Right arrow key to rotate the camera to the right around origin.

Exit the program with 'q', 'Q', or the Esc key.

PROGRAM: transform4x4

Usage: .transform4x4

To read in a file to be parsed intead of user input, pass a file in as follows:
./transform4x4 < ../hw1_data-1/transform1.tf 

The output will be the resulting transformed matrix, and will be sent to std::cout.
We take the identity 4x4 matrix and apply each transformation that is parsed from input
in order, to result in the final 4x4 transform matrix.  Note that we do not allow
rotation around (0,0,0).

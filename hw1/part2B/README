PROGRAM: draw2d

Usage: ./draw2d [xmin] [xmax] [ymin] [ymax] [xRes] [yRes]

This program takes many polylines (consisting of any number of points between
xmin and xmax, and ymin and ymax, and then draws those lines in white).

To read in a file to be parsed intead of user input, pass a file in as follows:
./draw2d -1.5 1.5 -1.5 1.5 400 400 < ../hw1_data-1/nonagons-box.2d

To save the output PPM format to a file instead of cout, send to a file as follows:
./draw2d -1.5 1.5 -1.5 1.5 400 400 < ../hw1_data-1/nonagons-box.2d > nonagaons-box.ppm
(Note: could also pipe to display or convert instead of saving to a file)

To compile this program, simple type "make" (or if on OSX, "make -f Makefile.macosx").

This will create an executable called "editSpline".

PROGRAM: oglRenderer

Usage: ./editSpline xRes yRes [.iv file]

For example, run as follows:
./editSpline 400 400

The program will display the control polyline (in white), which connects all 
of the control points (in red).  In yellow, the spline is displayed, which is 
calculated using the Cox de Boor algorithm.

The program starts with a basic U shape with 4 control points, and a knot vector
of <0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1>
Press 'r' to reset the control points and polyline to the original U shape.

Click on a red control points and drag it around to update the shape of the
control polyline.  The control polyline and spline will be updated accordingly
in real time.  
Control-Click on the display of the spline (the yellow curve) to add a control 
point (and thus a knot) that will keep the curve looking the same.  
For example, if you click on a point 50% of the way along the curve, we will 
add a knot value of 0.5 to the knot vector (inserting it such that the knot
vector is still nondecreasing).  We then update the control points based 
on the new knot vector and old control points.

Exit the program with 'q', 'Q', or the Esc key.

TOGGLE CONTROL POLYLINE:
Press 'w' to toggle the control polyline on and off.  Note that no editing is 
possible when the polyline is toggled off.  The program starts with the
control polyline toggled on.

LOAD/SAVE FEATURE:
To use this feature, pass in a file name as the optional 3rd parameter.  The file
will store data of the control points and the knot vector.
If the file already exists, we load in the data and display the according spline.
If the file doesn't exist, just start at the original U shape.
Press 's' to save the control polyline and the knot vector to the specified file
(the 3rd parameter).
Example:
./editSpline 400 400 splineData.txt
to load data from splineData.txt.  When we press 's' to save, the control points and 
knots will be saved to splineData.txt.

File Format for load save feature (note that the string "Knot Vector:" acts as a 
seperator betwen the control points and the knot vector values):
ControlPoint1.x ControlPoint1.y
ControlPoint2.x ControlPoint2.y
...
Knot Vector:
knotVector[0]
knotVector[1]
knotVector[2]
...

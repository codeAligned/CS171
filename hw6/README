To compile this program, simple type "make" (or if on OSX, uncomment the correct 
CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS lines in the Makefile). Also, make sure we can use -lpng, 
since we need it to read in the textures in .png format.

This will create an executable called "oglTexRenderer".

PROGRAM: oglTexRenderer

Usage: ./oglTexRenderer xRes yRes < .iv file

For example, run as follows:
oglTexRenderer 400 400 < hw6-data/cube.iv

The program will display every separator block in the .iv file (each block 
contains and object and its associated texture as a .png file).  The textures 
must all be in the hw-6 data directory in order to be loaded.  In addition, 
we will display an animated water surface below the object (note that this 
requires "sky.png" to be in your hw6-data directory).  The normals are 
computed analytically, as it only depends on distance from the origin, 
which gives the surface the ripple like effect.

EXTRA CREDIT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND:
Added sky.png in the background so it looks like the sky is actually being 
reflected.  This is implemented in drawBackDrop, as as we draw a rotated 
gluCylinder around the object.
'f': increase the speed of the ripples.
'g': decrease the speed of the ripples. (Clamp to minimum of 0.0)


UI Transformations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: These are all left over from last time, and using them may reveal how 
the sky backdrop is drawn as a cylinder and the reflection is just a 
plane at y = -1.  To reset to the original camera position and orientation, 
just press 'r'.

SHIFT+LEFT drag: Zoom 
    (Zoom implemented as a -z transformation based on the vertical drag)

LEFT drag: Pan
    (Panning implemented as a translation in x and y based on the horizontal 
	and vertical drag)
RIGHT drag: Rotate around the object 
    (Rotation implemented as rotation around the axis that was dragged, with 
    the angle proportional to the length of the drag)

'r': Reset
    reset the position and orientation of the camera to the original position.

'q' or 'Esc': Exit
